## ðŸ“– Problem Statement
The potential energy of two atoms in a molecule can be approximated by the **Morse Potential**:

\[
U(r) = A \left[ \left(e^{(R-r)/S} - 1 \right)^2 - 1 \right]
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the distance between the two atoms.
- \( A, R, S \) are positive constants with \( S \ll R \).

### ðŸ”¹ Tasks
1. **Sketch** \( U(r) \) for \( 0 < r < \infty \).
2. **Find the equilibrium separation** \( r_0 \), where \( U(r) \) is minimized.
3. **For small displacements** \( r = r_0 + x \), show that \( U \) takes the quadratic form:
   \[
   U \approx \text{const} + \frac{1}{2} k x^2
   \]
   confirming Hookeâ€™s Law.
4. **Find the force constant** \( k \).

## ðŸ“Œ Solution Summary
- The equilibrium separation is found at \( r = R \), meaning \( r_0 = R \).
- Taylor expanding the exponential term in \( U \), the energy function simplifies to a quadratic form, confirming Hookeâ€™s Law.
- The force constant is given by:

  \[
  k = \frac{2A}{S^2}
  \]

This result shows that for small oscillations around equilibrium, the Morse potential behaves like a harmonic oscillator.
